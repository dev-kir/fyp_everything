CHAPTER SECTION: 4.4 Scenario 2 Results
PLACEMENT: When presenting horizontal scaling results

FIGURE TITLE:
"Scenario 2: Complete Horizontal Scaling Cycle (Scale-Up and Scale-Down)"

FIGURE CAPTION:
"Timeline showing complete scaling cycle from Attempt 21-28 testing: initial
state (1 replica), three scale-up events (1→2→3→4 replicas) triggered by high
CPU and network utilization, sustained traffic period, and three scale-down
events (4→3→2→1) after 180-second idle detection. Total cycle duration: 31
minutes."

DESCRIPTION FOR LATEX (Extended Timeline):

COMPLETE SCALING CYCLE TIMELINE:

PHASE 1: INITIAL STATE (T0 to T+60s)
06:16:00 - Service deployed: web-stress with 1 replica on worker-3
06:16:00 - Alpine load test begins (4 nodes × 15 users = 60 concurrent)
06:16:00 - CPU rises from 30% → 77%, Network 98% (combined stress)

PHASE 2: FIRST SCALE-UP (T+60s)
06:16:00 (+0s from test start)
│ EVENT: Threshold detected (CPU=77.79%, Mem=20.8%, Net=98%)
│ SCENARIO: Scenario 2 (high CPU AND high network > 65%)
│ ACTION: Scale 1 → 2 replicas
│ LATENCY: 0.01 seconds (10 milliseconds!)
▼
06:16:05 (+5s)
│ EVENT: New replica (web-stress.2) on worker-1 transitions to "Running"
│ EFFECT: CPU distributed: worker-3 38%, worker-1 39% (77% ÷ 2 ≈ 38.5%)
│ VALIDATION: Grafana shows even load distribution

PHASE 3: SECOND SCALE-UP (T+120s) - Cooldown Respected
06:17:00 (+60s from first scale-up)
│ EVENT: Both replicas still at high CPU (75%+)
│ COOLDOWN: 60 seconds elapsed since last scale-up (PASS)
│ ACTION: Scale 2 → 3 replicas
│ LATENCY: 0.01 seconds
▼
06:17:05 (+5s)
│ EVENT: New replica (web-stress.3) on worker-4 transitions to "Running"
│ EFFECT: CPU distributed: 75% × 2 ÷ 3 = 50% per replica
│ VALIDATION: Three containers visible in Grafana

PHASE 4: THIRD SCALE-UP (T+180s)
06:18:00 (+60s from second scale-up)
│ EVENT: All three replicas still at moderate-high CPU (~50%)
│ COOLDOWN: 60 seconds elapsed (PASS)
│ ACTION: Scale 3 → 4 replicas
│ LATENCY: 0.01 seconds
▼
06:18:05 (+5s)
│ EVENT: New replica (web-stress.4) on worker-2 transitions to "Running"
│ EFFECT: CPU distributed: 50% × 3 ÷ 4 = 37.5% per replica
│ VALIDATION: Four containers, all below 40% CPU

PHASE 5: SUSTAINED TRAFFIC (T+240s to T+1200s)
06:18:05 to 06:36:00 (18 minutes)
│ STATE: 4 replicas handling load
│ CPU: Each replica at 35-40% (stable, below threshold)
│ NETWORK: Distributed evenly across replicas
│ NO FURTHER SCALING: Load balanced, cooldown prevents oscillation

PHASE 6: TRAFFIC STOPS (T+1200s)
06:36:00
│ EVENT: Alpine load test completed (Ctrl+C on all nodes)
│ STATE: 4 replicas now idle
│ CPU: Each replica drops to ~30% (no external traffic)

PHASE 7: FIRST SCALE-DOWN (T+1380s) - 180s Idle Requirement
06:39:00 (+180s sustained idle)
│ EVENT: Background thread detects idle state
│ FORMULA: total_cpu = 120% < 75% × (4-1) = 225% ✓
│ IDLE DURATION: 180 seconds (requirement met)
│ ACTION: Scale 4 → 3 replicas
│ DOCKER: Removes newest replica (web-stress.4 on worker-2, LIFO)
│ LATENCY: 0.02 seconds

PHASE 8: SECOND SCALE-DOWN (T+1620s)
06:43:00 (+240s from scale-down start)
│ EVENT: Still idle, cooldown passed
│ FORMULA: total_cpu = 90% < 75% × (3-1) = 150% ✓
│ ACTION: Scale 3 → 2 replicas
│ DOCKER: Removes web-stress.3 on worker-4

PHASE 9: FINAL SCALE-DOWN (T+1860s)
06:47:00 (+420s from scale-down start)
│ EVENT: Still idle, cooldown passed
│ FORMULA: total_cpu = 60% < 75% × (2-1) = 75% ✓
│ ACTION: Scale 2 → 1 replicas
│ DOCKER: Removes web-stress.2 on worker-1
│ FINAL STATE: 1 replica on worker-3 (original state restored)

TOTAL CYCLE DURATION: 31 minutes (6:16:00 to 6:47:00)

```

ACADEMIC ANALYSIS:
"Figure 4.5 demonstrates the complete autoscaling lifecycle over 31 minutes,
showing asymmetric behavior by design: scale-up events occur reactively within
seconds of traffic increases (0.01s latency), while scale-down events wait
conservatively for 180 seconds of sustained idle state before reclaiming
resources, preventing flapping during temporary traffic lulls."

FIGURE 4.6: Load Distribution Across Scaled Replicas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER SECTION: 4.4 Scenario 2 Results
PLACEMENT: After timeline, when discussing distribution validation

FIGURE TITLE:
"CPU Load Distribution Validation Across Horizontally Scaled Replicas"

FIGURE CAPTION:
"CPU utilization percentage across three scaled replicas after Attempt 27 fix
(external traffic distribution). Shows even distribution (27±1% CPU per replica)
validating Docker Swarm's round-robin load balancing. Comparison with Attempt
26 (before fix) demonstrates importance of external traffic for realistic load
testing."

DESCRIPTION FOR LATEX (Bar Chart Comparison):

BEFORE FIX (Attempt 26) - Internal Stress Method:
Replica 1 (worker-1): 34% CPU ████████████████████████████████████
Replica 2 (worker-2): 0.8% CPU █
Replica 3 (worker-4): 1.5% CPU ██

Issue: Self-stress endpoint not distributed by load balancer
Coefficient of Variation: 95% (poor distribution)

AFTER FIX (Attempt 27) - External Traffic Method:
Replica 1 (worker-1): 27% CPU ███████████████████████████████
Replica 2 (worker-2): 26% CPU ██████████████████████████████
Replica 3 (worker-4): 27% CPU ███████████████████████████████

Solution: Alpine Pi nodes generate external CPU-intensive traffic (/compute/pi)
Coefficient of Variation: 2.2% (excellent distribution)
Standard Deviation: 0.58%
Mean: 26.67% CPU

    bar width=0.4cm,

    nodes near coords align={vertical},
  ]

  % Before fix (Attempt 26)

  \legend{Before Fix (Internal Stress), After Fix (External Traffic)}
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
```

ACADEMIC CONTEXT:
"The load distribution analysis (Figure 4.6) reveals a critical lesson for
container orchestration testing: internal stress endpoints (self-induced CPU
load) are not distributed by Docker Swarm's load balancer, whereas external
HTTP requests are distributed round-robin. This finding (discovered in Attempt
27) necessitated redesigning the test methodology to use Alpine Pi-generated
external traffic, ultimately validating even load distribution with a coefficient
of variation of only 2.2%."

FIGURE 4.7: MTTR Comparison - Proactive vs Reactive
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER SECTION: 4.5 Comparative Analysis
PLACEMENT: When comparing SwarmGuard to Docker Swarm baseline

FIGURE TITLE:
"Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) Comparison: Proactive vs Reactive Recovery"

FIGURE CAPTION:
"Direct comparison of MTTR between Docker Swarm's reactive recovery (health check
failure detection) and SwarmGuard's proactive recovery (threshold-based early
detection). Proactive approach achieves 55% reduction in MTTR (6.08s vs ~11s)
and 100% reduction in downtime (0s vs 11s)."

DESCRIPTION FOR LATEX (Grouped Bar Chart with Annotations):

METRICS COMPARED:
1. Detection Time
2. Recovery Time
3. Total MTTR
4. Downtime

REACTIVE (Docker Swarm Default):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Detection Time: 15-30 seconds (health check)    │
│ Recovery Time: 10-15 seconds (restart)          │
│ Total MTTR: 25-45 seconds (average ~11s tested) │
│ Downtime: 11 seconds (container unavailable)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

PROACTIVE (SwarmGuard):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Detection Time: 10-15 seconds (threshold breach)│
│ Recovery Time: 6.08 seconds (migration)         │
│ Total MTTR: 6.08 seconds                        │
│ Downtime: 0 seconds (zero downtime)             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

IMPROVEMENT:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MTTR Improvement: 55% reduction                 │
│ Downtime Improvement: 100% elimination          │

```

ACADEMIC SIGNIFICANCE:
"The comparative analysis (Figure 4.7) empirically validates the hypothesis that
proactive recovery outperforms reactive approaches in both MTTR (55% reduction)
and availability (zero downtime vs. 11 seconds). This represents a significant
improvement for latency-sensitive applications where even brief service
interruptions impact user experience."

CHAPTER SECTION: 4.6 Resource Overhead Evaluation
PLACEMENT: When discussing system overhead and efficiency

FIGURE TITLE:
"SwarmGuard Monitoring Overhead Across Resource Dimensions"

FIGURE CAPTION:
"Resource overhead introduced by SwarmGuard components (monitoring agents,
recovery manager) compared to baseline Docker Swarm cluster. All overhead
metrics well below acceptable thresholds: CPU < 2% (target: <5%), Memory
~50MB per agent (target: <100MB), Network <0.5Mbps (target: <1Mbps)."

OPTION 1: Radar Chart (Resource Dimensions)

Dimensions:
1. CPU Overhead (%)
2. Memory Overhead (MB)
3. Network Overhead (Mbps)
4. Disk I/O (negligible)
5. Response Time Impact (%)

TARGET vs ACHIEVED:
- CPU: Target <5%, Achieved <2%
- Memory: Target <100MB, Achieved ~50MB
- Network: Target <1Mbps, Achieved <0.5Mbps
- Disk I/O: Target <1MB/s, Achieved ~0.1MB/s

```

ACADEMIC CONTEXT:
"Resource overhead analysis (Figure 4.8) demonstrates that SwarmGuard's
monitoring and recovery mechanisms introduce minimal performance degradation,
with all dimensions well below acceptable thresholds. Notably, network overhead
constitutes only 0.01% of the 100Mbps network capacity, validating the design
decision to optimize for bandwidth-constrained environments."

FIGURE 4.9: Network Bandwidth Budget Breakdown
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHAPTER SECTION: 4.6 Resource Overhead Evaluation
PLACEMENT: After Figure 4.8, detailed network analysis

FIGURE TITLE:
"Network Bandwidth Budget Breakdown on 100Mbps Infrastructure"

FIGURE CAPTION:
"Detailed breakdown of network bandwidth utilization showing SwarmGuard
monitoring traffic (alerts + metrics) consuming <0.5Mbps total, leaving >99.5%
available for application traffic. Validates network optimization strategy for
legacy 100Mbps Ethernet environments."

DESCRIPTION FOR LATEX (Stacked Bar Chart or Pie Chart):

TOTAL CAPACITY: 100 Mbps (12.5 MB/s)

BREAKDOWN:

1. Application Traffic: 99.5 Mbps (99.5%)
   - Web-stress service traffic
   - User requests
   - Response data

2. SwarmGuard Monitoring Overhead: 0.5 Mbps (0.5%)
   a. InfluxDB Metrics (Batched): 0.4 Mbps
      - 5 agents × 2 KB/batch × 0.1 batches/second
      - 10-second batching interval
      - InfluxDB Line Protocol (compact)

   b. Recovery Manager Alerts (Event-Driven): 0.1 Mbps
      - Only when threshold exceeded
      - 500-byte JSON payload
      - HTTP keepalive connection (reused)
      - Frequency: ~0.01 alerts/second (average)

3. Reserved for Overhead: <0.01 Mbps (negligible)
   - Docker Swarm gossip protocol
   - Health check traffic
   - DNS queries

HYPOTHETICAL SCALING ANALYSIS:

At 100 nodes with 50 containers each:
- InfluxDB traffic: 100 nodes × 50 containers × 0.16 Kbps = 800 Kbps
- Alert traffic: 100 nodes × 0.4 Kbps = 40 Kbps
- Total: 840 Kbps = 0.84 Mbps
- Still < 1% of 100Mbps capacity ✓

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \pie[
    text=legend,
    radius=3,
    color={green!50, blue!30, red!30}
  ]{

    0.4/InfluxDB Metrics,
    0.1/Recovery Alerts

  \node[color=green!70!black] at (0,-4.5) {SwarmGuard Overhead: <0.5 Mbps (0.5\%)};
\end{tikzpicture}
```

ACADEMIC JUSTIFICATION:
"The network bandwidth budget (Figure 4.9) demonstrates that SwarmGuard's
design—featuring batched metrics collection and event-driven alerting—is
well-suited for bandwidth-constrained legacy infrastructure. Even on a 100Mbps
network (common in small-to-medium enterprises), monitoring overhead remains
negligible at 0.5%, with hypothetical scaling to 100 nodes still maintaining
<1% overhead."

"The hypothesis validation results (Table 4.10) demonstrate robust empirical
support for all four research hypotheses, with multiple validation methods
employed to ensure confidence: controlled comparisons for H1, continuous
availability monitoring for H2, observability-based measurement for H3, and
analytical calculation for H4. Notably, all hypotheses were confirmed with
quantitative evidence, addressing the research questions posed in Chapter 1."

SECTION 1: LaTeX Document Setup
--------------------------------

PREAMBLE (Essential Packages):
```latex
\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{report}  % or {book} for FYP

% Graphics and figures
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.18}

% TikZ libraries
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,arrows,positioning,calc,patterns,decorations.pathreplacing}

% Tables
\usepackage{booktabs}  % Professional tables
\usepackage{multirow}  % Multi-row cells
\usepackage{colortbl}  % Colored cells
\usepackage{longtable} % Tables spanning pages

% Code listings
\usepackage{listings}
\usepackage{xcolor}

% References and captions
\usepackage{caption}
\usepackage{subcaption}
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}  % Clickable references

% Figure placement
\usepackage{float}
\usepackage{placeins}  % \FloatBarrier command
```

SECTION 2: Figure Placement Best Practices
-------------------------------------------

PLACEMENT SPECIFIERS:
- [h]: Here (preferred location, but LaTeX may override)
- [t]: Top of page
- [b]: Bottom of page
- [p]: Page of floats
- [H]: HERE (forces exact position, requires \usepackage{float})
- [!htbp]: Override LaTeX's preferences (use sparingly)

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
```latex
% For most figures (let LaTeX optimize)
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/architecture.pdf}
  \caption{System Architecture}
  \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

% For critical positioning (e.g., must be near specific text)
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  ...
\end{figure}

% Prevent figures from floating too far
\FloatBarrier  % Place before new section
```

SECTION 3: TikZ Compilation Best Practices
-------------------------------------------

EXTERNALIZATION (Speed up compilation):
```latex
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{external}
\tikzexternalize[prefix=tikz-cache/]  % Cache compiled TikZ figures

% In document:
\tikzsetnextfilename{architecture-diagram}  % Name the cached file
\begin{tikzpicture}
  ...
\end{tikzpicture}
```

STANDALONE FIGURES (Compile TikZ separately):
```latex
% File: figures/architecture.tex
\documentclass[tikz,border=5mm]{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes,arrows,positioning}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  ... (TikZ code) ...
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

% Compile separately: pdflatex figures/architecture.tex
% Include in main document:
\includegraphics{figures/architecture.pdf}
```

SECTION 4: Color Guidelines for Academic Documents
---------------------------------------------------

RECOMMENDED COLOR PALETTE:
```latex
% Define custom colors (professional, print-friendly)
\definecolor{swarmblue}{RGB}{0,102,204}    % Primary (trust, tech)
\definecolor{swarmgreen}{RGB}{0,153,76}    % Success, positive
\definecolor{swarmorange}{RGB}{255,127,0}  % Warning, attention
\definecolor{swarmred}{RGB}{204,0,0}       % Error, critical
\definecolor{swarmgray}{RGB}{102,102,102}  % Neutral, background

% Use consistently:
% - Blue: System components, architecture
% - Green: Success states, improvements
% - Orange: Warnings, intermediate states
% - Red: Errors, problems, reactive baseline
% - Gray: Infrastructure, supporting elements
```

ACCESSIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Use patterns in addition to colors (for colorblind readers)
- Ensure sufficient contrast (text on background)
- Test in grayscale (print-friendly)

```latex
% Pattern example for bar charts
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[ybar]
    \addplot[fill=blue!50,pattern=north east lines] ...;  % Proactive
    \addplot[fill=red!50,pattern=dots] ...;               % Reactive
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
```

SECTION 5: Caption Writing Best Practices
------------------------------------------

STRUCTURE OF GOOD CAPTIONS:
1. First sentence: What the figure shows (overview)
2. Second sentence: Key takeaway or interpretation
3. Optional third sentence: Methodology or context

EXAMPLES:

GOOD:
"Figure 3.6: Zero-Downtime Migration Algorithm Flowchart. Step-by-step algorithm
for proactive container migration ensuring zero downtime through START-FIRST
rolling update ordering. Critical steps include stale alert detection (Step 1),
placement constraint configuration (Step 2), and rolling update with overlap
(Steps 3-4)."

AVOID (Too Brief):
"Figure 3.6: Migration Algorithm."

AVOID (Too Verbose):
"Figure 3.6: This figure shows the complete flowchart for the zero-downtime
migration algorithm which includes many steps such as receiving an alert and
then checking if the container is still on the node and then configuring
constraints and then..."

SECTION 6: Cross-Referencing Figures
-------------------------------------

LABELING:
```latex
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  ...
  \caption{System Architecture}
  \label{fig:architecture}  % Label AFTER caption
\end{figure}
```

REFERENCING IN TEXT:
```latex
% Basic reference
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}, the system consists of...

% Reference with page number
The architecture (Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}, page~\pageref{fig:architecture})...

% Multiple figures
Figures~\ref{fig:arch} and~\ref{fig:flow} illustrate...

% Using cleveref package (recommended)
\usepackage{cleveref}
As shown in \cref{fig:architecture}, the system...  % Automatically adds "Figure"
```

SECTION 7: Figure Resolution and Format Guidelines
---------------------------------------------------

RECOMMENDED FORMATS:
- Vector graphics: PDF, SVG, EPS (preferred for diagrams, charts)
- Raster graphics: PNG (for screenshots, photos)
- Avoid: JPEG (lossy compression, not suitable for text)

RESOLUTION GUIDELINES:
- Raster images: Minimum 300 DPI for print
- Screenshots: Scale appropriately (don't enlarge beyond 100%)
- Vector graphics: No resolution concerns (scalable)

NAMING CONVENTION:
```
figures/
├── 01-reactive-vs-proactive-timeline.pdf
├── 02-deployment-environment.pdf
├── 03-01-overall-architecture.pdf
├── 03-06-migration-algorithm.pdf
├── 04-01-performance-summary.pdf
├── 04-02-migration-timeline.pdf
├── 04-03-grafana-migration-screenshot.png
└── 04-07-mttr-comparison.pdf
```

SECTION 8: Table Formatting Best Practices
-------------------------------------------

PROFESSIONAL TABLES (booktabs package):
```latex
\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Performance Metrics Summary}
\begin{tabular}{lccr}
\toprule  % Top horizontal line (thick)
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Target} & \textbf{Achieved} & \textbf{Status} \\
\midrule  % Middle horizontal line (medium)
Alert Latency & <1s & 7-9ms & ✅ \\
Migration MTTR & <10s & 6.08s & ✅ \\
Downtime & <3s & 0s & ✅ \\
\bottomrule  % Bottom horizontal line (thick)
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:performance}
\end{table}
```

AVOID:
- Vertical lines (clutter, not professional)
- Excessive horizontal lines (use only top, mid, bottom)
- Inconsistent alignment (use l, c, r appropriately)

SECTION 9: TikZ Style Definitions (Reusable)
---------------------------------------------

DEFINE ONCE, USE EVERYWHERE:
```latex
% In preamble or separate swarmguard-styles.tex
\tikzset{
  % Node styles
  component/.style={
    rectangle,
    draw=black,
    thick,
    fill=blue!20,
    minimum width=2.5cm,
    minimum height=1.2cm,
    align=center,
    font=\small
  },
  decision/.style={
    diamond,
    draw=black,
    thick,
    fill=yellow!30,
    minimum width=2cm,
    minimum height=1.5cm,
    align=center,
    font=\small,
    aspect=2
  },
  process/.style={
    rectangle,
    draw=black,
    thick,
    fill=green!20,
    minimum width=3cm,
    minimum height=1cm,
    align=center,
    font=\small,
    rounded corners=2mm
  },
  % Arrow styles
  dataarrow/.style={
    ->,
    >=stealth,
    thick,
    blue
  },
  controlflow/.style={
    ->,
    >=stealth,
    thick,
    red
  }
}

% Usage in document:
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node[component] (agent) at (0,0) {Monitoring\\Agent};
  \node[process] (check) at (3,0) {Threshold\\Check};
  \draw[dataarrow] (agent) -- (check);
\end{tikzpicture}
```

SECTION 10: Version Control for Figures
----------------------------------------

BEST PRACTICES:
1. Keep source files (TikZ .tex, .svg, draw.io .xml) in version control
2. Commit generated PDFs separately (or add to .gitignore if large)
3. Use descriptive commit messages for figure changes
4. Tag major versions (e.g., "v1.0-figures-final-draft")

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

TOTAL EFFORT ESTIMATE:
- High Priority (5 figures): 10-15 hours
- Medium Priority (5 figures): 8-12 hours
- Lower Priority (3 figures): 5-8 hours
- Optional (4 figures): 6-10 hours
- All 37 elements: 60-100 hours

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
1. Week 1: High Priority (5 figures) - 2-3 hours/day
2. Week 2: Medium Priority (5 figures) - 1-2 hours/day
3. Week 3: Polish and optional figures - 1 hour/day

================================================================================
FIGURE CREATION WORKFLOW
================================================================================

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:

1. PLANNING (30 minutes per figure)
   - Review figure specification from this document
   - Sketch on paper (rough layout)
   - Identify data/content sources

2. CREATION (1-5 hours per figure, depending on complexity)
   - TikZ: Create .tex file in figures/source/
   - Screenshot: Capture from Grafana, annotate if needed
   - Table: Structure data in Excel/CSV first, then LaTeX

3. COMPILATION (10 minutes)
   - Compile standalone TikZ figure
   - Generate PDF
   - Check output quality

4. INTEGRATION (15 minutes)
   - Include in appropriate chapter .tex file
   - Write caption (2-3 sentences)
   - Add \label{} for cross-referencing

5. REVIEW (20 minutes)
   - Compile full document
   - Check figure placement
   - Verify caption accuracy
   - Test cross-references

6. ITERATION (30 minutes - 2 hours)
   - Supervisor feedback
   - Adjust colors, layout, labels
   - Ensure consistency across figures
   - Recompile and verify

================================================================================
END OF FIGURE PLAN PART 3
================================================================================

You now have:
1. Complete specifications for 32 figures + 5 tables = 37 visual elements
2. LaTeX TikZ structure templates for all diagram types
3. Best practices for professional academic figures
4. Priority recommendations (start with 5 HIGH priority figures)
5. Effort estimates (60-100 hours total, 10-15 for priorities)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Read FYP_5_ACADEMIC_CHAPTER_MAPPING.txt for chapter structure
2. Start with Chapter 4 (results) - easiest to write
3. Create HIGH PRIORITY figures first (5 figures, 10-15 hours)
4. Write Chapter 4 text referencing those figures
5. Work backwards to Chapter 3, 1, 2, 5

Good luck with your figure creation and FYP report writing!
