---

## 🚀 Your Three Next Steps

### 1️⃣ Read the Guides (30 minutes)

Start with the **easiest** guide:
```bash
cat QUICK_START.md
```

Then read the **comprehensive** workflow:
```bash
cat README.md
```

### 2️⃣ Understand Your Project Context (15 minutes)

These files explain your SwarmGuard project for Claude Chat:
```bash
cat 00-project-context/project_overview.md
cat 00-project-context/objectives.md
```

### 3️⃣ Choose Your Path

**Path A: I have SwarmGuard test results already**
→ Skip to Phase 3 (Research in Claude Chat)
→ Start writing chapters immediately

**Path B: I need to run tests first**
→ Start with Phase 2 (Evidence Collection)
→ See: `03-chapter4-evidence/commands_template.md`

---

## 📖 The Workflow (5 Phases)

```
Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETE - Setup
         Claude Code analyzed your codebase
         Generated all templates and guides

Phase 2: 🔄 YOUR TURN - Evidence Collection
         Run SwarmGuard tests
         Collect performance data
         Save outputs to raw_outputs/

Phase 3: 🔍 Claude Chat - Deep Research
         Find 50-80 academic papers
         Write literature review (Chapter 2)
         Write intro, methodology, conclusions

Phase 4: 📊 Claude Code + Chat - Results
         Process test data (Claude Code)
         Write results chapter (Claude Chat)
         Create figures and tables

Phase 5: 📚 Claude Code - Final Assembly
         Combine all chapters
         Format bibliography
         Generate LaTeX/PDF
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why This Workflow Works

1. **Project-Specific:** Based on YOUR actual SwarmGuard implementation
2. **Two-Tool Strategy:**
   - Claude Code: Project context, data processing
   - Claude Chat: Deep research, academic writing
3. **Bottom-Up Approach:** Start with results (Ch 4), work backwards
4. **Systematic:** Clear phases, detailed instructions, no guesswork

### What Makes This Different

- ✅ **Not generic** - Tailored to SwarmGuard architecture
- ✅ **Research-ready** - Specific paper queries for Deep Research
- ✅ **Evidence-based** - Commands to run actual tests
- ✅ **Template-driven** - Chapter structures pre-built

---

## 📊 Expected Output

When you complete this workflow, you'll have:

### Final Thesis:
- **75-99 pages** (industry-standard FYP length)
- **5 chapters** (Introduction, Lit Review, Methodology, Results, Conclusions)
- **50-80 citations** (academic papers + technical docs)
- **15-25 figures** (architecture diagrams, results graphs)
- **10-20 tables** (performance comparisons)

### Chapter Breakdown:
| Chapter | Pages | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| 1. Introduction | 5-7 | Problem, objectives, significance |
| 2. Literature Review | 15-20 | Related work, gap analysis |
| 3. Methodology | 20-25 | Design, implementation, testing |
| 4. Results & Discussion | 20-25 | Performance data, analysis |
| 5. Conclusions | 5-7 | Contributions, limitations, future work |
