# Quick Start Guide - FYP Report Writing

**You are ready to start writing your FYP report!** 🎉

---

## ✅ Setup Complete

Claude Code has created:
- ✅ Complete directory structure (7 folders)
- ✅ 16 markdown files with detailed instructions
- ✅ Project context documents (3 files)
- ✅ Research requirement lists (4 files)
- ✅ Chapter 4 evidence collection templates
- ✅ Chapter structure files (5 chapters)
- ✅ Bibliography template

---

## 🚀 What to Do Next (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Read the Main README
```bash
cd fyp-report
cat README.md
```

**This README contains:**
- Complete workflow explanation
- Phase-by-phase instructions
- Timeline estimates
- Troubleshooting tips

---

### Step 2: Choose Your Starting Point

You have **two paths** depending on where you are:

#### Path A: You have already run SwarmGuard tests
→ Go directly to Phase 3 (Research in Claude Chat)
```bash
# Open Claude Chat
# Upload: 00-project-context/project_overview.md
# Upload: 01-research-requirements/papers_needed_ch2.md
# Start Deep Research!
```

#### Path B: You need to run tests first
→ Start with Phase 2 (Evidence Collection)
```bash
cd fyp-report/03-chapter4-evidence
cat commands_template.md

# Run commands in your SwarmGuard environment
# Save outputs to raw_outputs/
```

---

### Step 3: Follow the Workflow

The workflow is designed to be linear and systematic:

```
Phase 1: ✅ Setup (DONE by Claude Code)
    ↓
Phase 2: 🔄 Evidence Collection (YOU)
    ↓
Phase 3: 🔍 Research (Claude Chat)
    ↓
Phase 4: 📊 Results Writing (Claude Code + Claude Chat)
    ↓
Phase 5: 📚 Final Assembly (Claude Code)
```
